PYTHON  
-- Every thing in python is object 

-- interpreter it run code and check code line by line and translate to machine language(each line executed line by line)...
-- compiler it run code all at once and direct translate to machine language..

--Variables 
- snake_case its means all lover case and underscore will come in that while giving name to variables 
eg:- user_id = 10...
- start with lovercase and underscore
eg:- user_name , _user_name
-letter , number , underscore
-case sensitive
-Don't overwrite  keywords 


---> Matrix 
- in python matrix are 2D arrays[it means 2 dymencial array (array inside array)]
- eg :- matrix = [
    [1,2,3],
    [[1],2,3,4]
]
- array inside array its called sub array  

---> List Method 
method that add (.) after the list 
#adding 
print(xyz.append) 

#insert 
-- .insert modified list in place 
--  .insert is used to inset a value between the value for eg basket = [1,2,3]
basket.insert(2,100) -- so it will insert between 2 and 3 a number 100


#Extend 
-- .extend is an actual item or object take what we call an iterable that some thing we can loop 
new_list = basket.extend([100 , 101])
- it will modified list in place adds and Extend  the list 

#removing
1 pop
basket.pop()
print(basket)
it will remove latest add value and give 
how much we write it will remove all new added value that we had place 
if we do basket.pop(0)so i will removw from index os it will show output  [2,3,4] it will remove

2. remove 
basket.remove(4)
print(basket) 
it will remove  

3. CLEAR 
it will clear all the list value  and give blank output  

# index
-- it give a value , a start, and a stop 
eg:- basket = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(baskte.index(2))
so output will be 1 because number 2 is index of 1 
-- index is call  python keywords  \

--- there are so many keywords in python for example me are using "in" keywords it will show true and false 
eg basket(a,b,c,d)
